Archetype: Call Centre

What is it?  A call centre is a (logical, may also be a single-location, physical) collection of phone lines, usually staffed, used for receiving and/or transmitting a high volume of enquiries by telephone.   A Call Centre can be supplemented with an Interactive Voice Response unit that collects statistics and routes calls.  A Call Centre is often supported by a "tracking" system that helps steward a call or incident to some kind of resolution.
